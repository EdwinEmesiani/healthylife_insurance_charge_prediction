## What would you like to improve?

Describe the improvement (e.g. new features, different model, hyperparameters).

## Area

- [ ] Feature engineering
- [ ] Model choice (Linear, Tree, RF, etc.)
- [ ] Hyperparameter tuning
- [ ] Evaluation metrics / validation strategy

## Motivation

Why is this important for HealthyLife?  
(e.g. “Improve pricing accuracy for smokers”, “Reduce overfitting on small subgroups”)

## Suggested Approach

Outline your idea (e.g. “Try Gradient Boosting”, “Add interaction BMI × smoker”, etc.).

## Impact / Risk

Any potential side effects (e.g. higher latency, more complexity)?

## Additional Notes

References, benchmarks, or experiments if you have them.
