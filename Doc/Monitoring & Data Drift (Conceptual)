Monitoring & Data Drift (Conceptual)

The project sketches a monitoring loop:

Logging: Each prediction logs features + predicted charges.

Model drift: Compare the distribution of training targets vs live predictions. Significant shifts can trigger retraining.

Data drift: Compare feature means/variances (e.g. age, BMI) between training data and recent live traffic.

These checks can be extended with EvidentlyAI dashboards and integrated into a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.
