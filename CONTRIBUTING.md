This project is part of a broader portfolio focused on **building deployable AI systems**, not just training standalone models. The HealthyLife repo represents a **production-style ML system**:

- EDA →  
- Preprocessing & model pipelines →  
- Training script & packaging →  
- Gradio app deployment →  
- Logging, monitoring, and drift awareness.

The goal is to keep this repository **clean, reproducible, and production-minded**.
