Project: HealthyLife Insurance Charge Prediction (End-to-End ML System)
•	Built an end-to-end regression system to predict health insurance charges from demographic and lifestyle attributes using scikit-learn Pipelines with ColumnTransformer, StandardScaler, and OneHotEncoder.
•	Compared Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models; selected and deployed the best pipeline as a Gradio application on Hugging Face Spaces.
•	Implemented logging and drift-analysis concepts (request/prediction logging, model/data drift checks), and designed a retraining workflow using train.py, model.joblib, and planned CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
